<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Christopher Schultz. </p>

<p>I am 30 years old and looking to break into the tech industry. I have completed several online bootcamp courses and have worked on multiple portfolios that showcase my skills. Currently, I work full time as a nurse at the University of Missouri Hospital in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. I have thoroughly enjoyed my self-studies and projects and aim to elevate my skills to a professional level. I appreciate you taking the time to review my work and hope for the opportunity to work with you in the future.
